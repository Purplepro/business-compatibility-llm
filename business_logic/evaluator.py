def evaluate_business_pairs(business_a: dict, business_b: dict) -> str:
    """
    Evaluates the compatibility between two businesses using a language model and a structured prompt template.

    This function builds natural language profiles for two businesses using their attributes,
    injects them into a predefined prompt template, and uses a local LLM to generate a
    compatibility assessment.

    Parameters:
        business_a (dict): A dictionary containing attributes of the first business (e.g., name, type,
                           location, capacity, certifications, etc.).
        business_b (dict): A dictionary containing attributes of the second business.

    Returns:
        str: A natural language response from the LLM describing the compatibility verdict
             and the reasoning behind it.
    
    Example:
        evaluate_business_pairs(business_a, business_b)
        "**Verdict:** Compatible\n\n**Reasoning:** Both businesses share matching certifications, have
        complementary supply and demand profiles, and operate within the same region."
